# Alpha Vantage Stock Data ETL Pipeline

This project is a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built in Python. 
It fetches daily stock market data for specified companies (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT) from the Alpha Vantage API, 
transforms the data using Pandas, and loads it into a local SQLite database.
